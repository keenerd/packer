Packer
======

Packer is a bash wrapper for pacman and the AUR. It was designed to be
a simple and very fast replacement for the basic functionality of
yaourt. It allows you to install, update, search, and show information
for any package in the main repositories and in the AUR. For other
commands, such as removing packages, use pacman.
